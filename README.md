# VehicleCounter_V2


You may pause/unpause playing video with space and stop with esc. When paused, you may watch it frame-by-frame with any key (except for space and esc, of course).

## June, 20th, 2019.

Added option to log videos to a database. This program uses a database on the localhost but does not create it, so you'll need to do something with it to use this option.

Some minor fixes and code style changes.
